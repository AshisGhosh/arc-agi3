"""
Training Module

Training pipelines for neural components.

Phases:
1. Data collection via exploration
2. Neural predictor distillation from LLM
3. Neural policy training via BC + RL
4. Integration and optimization

Components:
- Distillation: LLM -> neural predictor
- RLFinetuning: Policy improvement
- Curriculum: Progressive difficulty
